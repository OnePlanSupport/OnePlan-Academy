"body" : "OnePlan is built on several modules that facilitate the sharing and management of project information across an organization. Using the Portfolio, Resource, and Financial plan modules in OnePlan, managers and executives can track and manage project data to make informed decisions, assess risk, effectively assign resources, streamline budgeting, and much more. Using OnePlan's work management modules, team members can easily update and manage their assignments, track time, and get updates on their relevant work. Portfolio and work management modules have a symbiotic relationship, feeding off of each other to create a living, dynamic PPM environment. As work is completed and tracked using the OnePlan work management tools, or other integrated work tools, the portfolio-level data is updated. As portfolio-level information is created, updated, and assigned, team members' work management tools are updated to keep their tasks and assignments up to date. " },

Using OnePlan's work management modules, team members can easily update and manage their assignments, track time, and get updates on their relevant work. Portfolio and work management modules have a symbiotic relationship, feeding off of each other to create a living, dynamic PPM environment. As work is completed and tracked using the OnePlan work management tools, or other integrated work tools, the portfolio-level data is updated.
